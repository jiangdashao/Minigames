one[/B][/SIZE]
[LIST]
[*][SIZE=4]Team Deathmatch: The traditional Paintball game mode. Whichever team gets the most kills wins[/SIZE]
[*][SIZE=4]Capture the Flag: Whichever team gets the most other team's flags to their base wins[/SIZE]
[*][SIZE=4]Rush the Flag: Same as Capture the flag, however there is only one flag in the middle. Each team 
fights for to rush it to their base.[/SIZE]
[*][SIZE=4]Free For All: Team Deathmatch, without the teams. Each player is on their own team.[/SIZE]
[*][SIZE=4]Domination: Each team has a 4x4 sqaure which other teams try and secure. They secure it by standing 
over it for a certain amount of time.Their score is subtracted every 10 seconds to the amount of bases they have 
(the more they keep secured the more points they get)[/SIZE]
[*][SIZE=4]Last Team Standing: No arena timer, the arena will not end until there is one team left, and that 
team wins.[/SIZE]
[*][SIZE=4]Destroy the Core: Each team has a "core" with levels. To win you destory the other team's core by 
throwing Paintballs at it. Whichever team is last alive or has the highest life on their core wins.[/SIZE]
[*][SIZE=4]Kill Confirmed: From Call of Duty. Like Team Deathmatch, however when you die you drop a tag. To 
confirm the kill you collect the tag and get points. If you do not confirm the kill and someone on the other 
team gets it, you do not get any points[/SIZE]

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/rDo1Y0f.png[/IMG]
[B]Optional[/B]
[URL='http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/holographic-displays/']HolographicDisplays[/URL]: Allows you to have 
access to /pb admin setholo [stat] and set hologram leaderbards
[URL='https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/']PlaceHolderAPI[/URL]: Gives you many place 
holders that can be used with other plugins like scoreboards and chat to display game specific infomation to 
players. Paintball placeholders syntax is paintball_{stat name}, where the stat name is lower cased name with no 
spaces. Example: paintball_kills, paintball_gamesplayed, paintball_kd, etc.
[URL='http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/vault/']Vault[/URL]: Allows this plugin to access the server's money 
(for buying items). Without this plugin all money exchanges will be removed and the only form of currency will 
be coins earned per kill
[URL='https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/leaderheads.2079/']LeaderboardHeads[/URL]: Paintball offers basic 
leaderboard handling-- top signs, holograms or heads. However, you can extend the leaderboards beyond limits 
with this plugin, create weekly, monthly, daily, or lifetime leaderboards, signs, npcs, etc. Then, you can even 
sync it to your server's website to see the stats online! (Please note this has been implemented on my side but 
may take a few weeks for the author to update it as he has exams)

[B]Why stop at up to 16 teams per arena?[/B]
[SPOILER="Answer"]
There are 16 color codes in Minecraft. Teams are set using color codes so I can easily link the player's team to 
a color code and display it in chat. Since there are only 16 color codes, there is a limit.
[/SPOILER]

[B]Which versions work where?[/B]
The latest version supports 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11 and 1.11.2, 1.12+
Basically 1.7 and down are not supported.

[B]How do I set an arena's teams?[/B]
[SPOILER="Answer"]
For example, if you wanted to make an arena with gold, yellow, white, and black, you would use: /pb arena 
setteams arena-name &6,&e,&f,&0. Which is way better than the traditional and limited blue and red teams. If you 
notice each new color is separated by a comma. If you wanted to add more just add another comma and a color 
code.
[/SPOILER]

[B]I have had some really bad past experiences with premium plugins and am hesitant on downloading 
anymore...[/B]
[SPOILER="Answer"]
Don't worry. I take your money's value extremely seriously. I have never neglected to help or add a new 
requested feature. If anything is wrong, I will look deeply into the issue. I have noticed a lot of premium 
plugins who offer terrible support... That will not happen here! Take a look at the discussion, I always reply 
back quick and deliver amazing support. I will even personally go to your server so I can see the issue in depth 
so I can fix it. Basically, you will never be left with bugs which make the game unplayable.

[B]How to setup BungeeCord? And how does it work?[/B]
[LIST=1]
[*]Go to bungee.yml, set bungee to true
[*]Go to bungee.yml set hub-server-id to the name of your hub server
[*]Download a plugin like BungeePortals or BungeeSigns to your hub server
[*]Place signs in hub server to send a player to the game server
[*]When the player clicks the hub sign, they will join the server and automatically join a game
[*]When a game ends, the arena will shut and players will be sent back to hub
[*]If you want the plugin to set the Bungee server's motd, inside bungee.yml set state-as-motd to true. Then use 
a plugin like BungeeSigns which would fetch the motd with %motd% placeholder to be displayed on a sign
[/LIST]

[B]I do not want this item in the Coin Shop![/B]
[SPOILER="Answer"]Inside items.yml, turn shown to false and your good to go! There are actually even a few in 
there that are set to false by default. Items like Fly, which should only be enabled if the owner wants 
it.[/SPOILER]

[B]What is the difference between Paintball's Coin and Money system?[/B]
[SPOILER="Answer"]Coins are the plugin's default money system. Coins are basically like killstreaks (You can set 
how many player's gain/loose on kill/death in config). Because they are like killstreaks, they reset every game. 
You can also have money if you install Vault. Money is saved throughout each arena, in other words it is never 
reset. You have the choice to remove Coins (set coins: false in config.yml). You have the choice to remove Money 
by not installing Vault, or, if you need Vault for another plugin you can just set all money values to 0. Or, 
you can even use both. To me, Coins are more to make it harder for people to buy new items because they cannot 
just save up their money for awhile. Money can be saved overtime and can make it easy to buy big items. This is 
the reason why there is a choice (or both) for you to pick from."][/SPOILER]

[B]What Java version does this support?[/B]
[SPOILER="Answer"]
This plugin was built off of Java 8 and will not support lower versions.
[/SPOILER]

[B]How exactly do I change a team name?[/B]
[SPOILER="Answer"]
After you set the teams, go into arenas.yml and find the "Teams" list in the arena you want to edit section. 
Rename the colored team to whatever you want. For example:
[CODE]Teams:
    - 0:Black
    - f:White[/CODE]
Would turn into:
[CODE]Teams:
    - 0:Chocolate
    - f:Vanilla[/CODE]
Save, and do /pb admin reload. (Note: The specific arena will not reload until it is not in progress)
[/SPOILER]

[B]I have "java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: UI_BUTTON_CLICK"?
Where is the list for all the materials and sounds I can choose from in items.yml?[/B]
[SPOILER="Answer"]
Some are added in 1.9 that are not in 1.8 so follow the version of your server. This will result in a 
NoSuchFieldError, especially for sounds because almost all sound names were changed from 1.8 to 1.9. The default 
Sound and Material values are for 1.9, so to get 1.8 support you must change to the 1.8 equivalent.

[B]I have an error![/B]
[SPOILER="Answer"]
First, download the latest version. If that does not fix it, PM me or post in the discussion your error and 
stacktrace if there is one.
